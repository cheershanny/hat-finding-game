# Hat in the Field Game

## Description

This is an interactive terminal-based game developed as part of my Codecademy learning. In this game, the player finds themselves in a field filled with holes and must navigate their way back to their lost hat. The objective is to avoid falling into holes and stay within the boundaries of the field while trying to find the hat.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Begin the game by running the program in your terminal.

2. **Field Size**: You will be prompted to input the size of the field. Enter a number greater than or equal to 2 when prompted.

3. **Field Generation**: The game will generate a random field with a path, holes, and your hat. The path is represented by '*', holes by 'O', and the hat by '^'.

4. **Starting Point**: You will start at the top-left corner of the field ('*').

5. **Movement**: You can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. Enter your desired move as input when prompted.

6. **Objective**: Try to navigate through the field, following the path ('*'), to find your hat ('^').

7. **Avoid Hazards**: Be careful not to step outside the boundaries of the field or fall into any holes ('O').

8. **Game Notifications**: The game will notify you if you fall into a hole or step out of bounds. If you find your hat, you win the game!

9. **Repeat Gameplay**: The game is played in a loop, so you can start a new game after finishing one.
